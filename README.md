# MissionChanger for MSFS  
MissionChanger changes the aircraft defined by the creator in your missions.
Maybe a later version will also change the weather, season and time for already running missions.

This app is experimental. Despite intensive testing, errors may occur. Please backup your community folder.

# Installation
Unzip the files to a folder of your choice and run "MissionChanger".
